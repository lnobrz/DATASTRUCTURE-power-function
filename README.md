challenge: write a function called power which accepts a base and an exponent. The function should return the power of the base to the exponent. This function should mimic the functionality of Math.pow()  - do not worry about negative bases and exponents.

I've done this challenge to improve my knowlege in algorithms, more especifically in recursive functions.
